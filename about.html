## About

Github's Octocat was designed by Simon Oxley, alongside the white bird Twitter used (before they received a proper logo) as part of a usual routine of cranking out images for iStock. GitHub saw it, and wanted it, presumably under the notion that it can represent how complex code combines to create peculiar things, much like the octopuss... except the CEO of GitHub called it an octocat, and it has been the octocat since <a href="https://www.quora.com/GitHub/What-is-the-story-behind-GitHub%E2%80%99s-octocat-mascot" target="_blank">[via]</a>.
